Thank you for confirming you no longer have unauthorized access. As part of our investigation, we also want to make sure we have all the relevant information from you to ensure we’re capturing everything, even as we review our own logs / audit records. As such, we would appreciate your answers to a few questions to assist us.

* Are there things outside of the screenshots you provided that you looked at? Specifically, did you review any specific programs, reports, etc.?
  * If so, could you list these programs?

* Did you provide any of this information to other people outside of your report submission?

* Have you made mention of this issue to any other people at all?

Much appreciated for the responses. Especially thank you for confirming your removal of all screenshots and other data you may have downloaded as part of your report submission.

We can confirm that ██████ uses 2FA via SAML. That is, the built-in HackerOne 2FA functionality is not used, as our identity provider handles 2FA itself. Authentication to the HackerOne Platform is federated from our identity provider to HackerOne via SAML.

Again, thanks for reporting this to us. We'll be in touch soon on next steps.",

We’re still actively working on this, primarily preparing communications to affected customers and a root cause analysis. As part of that, we’re updating the severity according to the impact of the vulnerability. At this point, we have not made a decision on the bounty amount, and it may be different from what our bounty table indicates. See below for our reasoning behind the corrected severity, which with the environmental score of the affected asset, brings the CVSS to 8.3 (High).

**Attack Vector: Network** - The vulnerability was exploitable from anywhere in case the attacker had a copy of an active session cookie.

**Attack Complexity: High** - The semi-feasible attack scenario is for a HackerOne employee to share an active session cookie. Carrying this out is beyond an attacker’s control, which is why the Attack Complexity to High.

**Privileges Required: None** - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction: Required** - The victim needs to share the session cookie, making User Interaction Required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Scope: Changed** - Due to the nature of the data that could’ve been accessed, systems other than hackerone.com may be accessible. Scope includes any customer assets because of the vulnerability information that could have been accessed.

**Confidentiality: High** - Vulnerability information could be accessed when the attacker has an active session cookie of the HackerOne employee. Any security vulnerability that affects vulnerability information automatically bumps Confidentiality to High.

**Integrity: High** - The HackerOne employee had sufficient privileges to make updates to programs they were managing, causing Impact to being set to High.

**Availability: High** - Due to the HackerOne employee’s permissions, they could suspend submissions for a number of HackerOne customers. Although this technically doesn’t affect the availability of the platform, the team ended up going with a High impact because submissions are a business critical process on the platform.",

* Three years ago I mentioned such an attack, but it was theoretical and I was not listened to( here #163381 I wrote \`in theory find this in the future\`). If this will help the I am systemic moderator on one of forums on security. And we protected ourselves from such attacks by binding the session to the IP address at the entrance. We also made basic authorization for access to private sections. Perhaps this will help you.

* I understand, that saw data which should not was see, but this was only hack interest in white purposes, I wanted to watch and show you to prejudice consequence of this can lead ( I've always been taught to write the full impact that can be) . It was a happy white hacking for me.

As for your first remark: yesterday we've released an update that limits HackerOne employees and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to the IP address that they've started the session with. This would've prevented the incident. We're postponing the rollout to all users due to people having legitimate use cases for using multiple IP addresses (e.g. ISPs with DHCP). We're also planning to roll out a number of smaller changes, such as warning the user when a comment seems to contain sensitive information and clarification in our policy about what to do when someone gains access to other people their account.

During our Incident Response process, we noticed that a few reports were accessed after you submitted the report to us. Although we understand why you did so, we’d like to stress that this behavior may disqualify you from a bounty in the future. In this particular case, we correlated the page views that were made after the submission with your comments providing more information to us to substantiate your claims. It also seemed that no information was withheld by you in this report.

To make it clear on how we believe these situations should be handled by hackers, [we’ve added a clarifying section to our policy](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684). We urge you to review this section, which will reduce the blast radius going forward. We’d like for you to continue to be a valuable member of the community and our top hacker, but for that, we require you to be mindful of the access that particular vulnerabilities give you. Being responsible and understanding the potential consequences of your actions is very important in this field. We hope you understand and will take this into consideration going forward.

We’re planning to publicly disclose this report on December 3, 2019 at 9:00am PST.

We look forward to receiving more security vulnerabilities from you in the future. Good luck and happy hacking!",

*Last updated: 2019-11-27*

## Issue Summary
On November 24, 2019 at 13:08 UTC, HackerOne was notified through the HackerOne Bug Bounty Program by a HackerOne community member (“hacker”) that they had accessed a HackerOne Security Analyst’s HackerOne account. A session cookie was disclosed due to a human error, which led to the hacker being able to access the account. The session cookie was revoked at 15:11 UTC, blocking all unauthorized access to the account.

The technical investigation finished at 21:27 UTC, concluding that there was no malicious intent and that all copies of potentially sensitive information were deleted.

## Root Cause
HackerOne triages incoming reports for HackerOne’s own bug bounty program. On November 24, 2019, a Security Analyst tried to reproduce a submission to HackerOne’s program, which failed. The Security Analyst replied to the hacker, accidentally including one of their own valid session cookies.

*Why was a cookie included?*
When a Security Analyst fails to reproduce a potentially valid security vulnerability, they go back and forth with the hacker to better understand the report. During this dialogue, Security Analysts may include steps they’ve taken in their response to the report, including HTTP requests that they made to reproduce. In this particular case, parts of a cURL command, copied from a browser console, were not removed before posting it to the report, disclosing the session cookie.

*Why was the hacker able to access the account?*
Session cookies are tied to a particular application, in this case hackerone.com. The application won’t block access when a session cookie gets reused in another location. This was a known risk. As many of HackerOne’s users work from mobile connections and through proxies, blocking access would degrade the user experience for those users. Due to the entropy of session cookies and in-depth defenses such as HackerOne’s strict [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy), HackerOne had not prioritized any additional defenses that limit a session cookie’s ability to be used in a separate browser.

*Why does a session cookie grant access to reports?*
HackerOne offers a number of additional tools on the platform for Security Analysts to work through security reports. In a normal situation, the Security Analysts go through multi-factor Single Sign-On (SSO) to obtain a valid session cookie for their work. Because a live session cookie was obtained, all platform features were available, which therefore granted access to a number of customers’ reports. This was limited to the customer programs that this particular Security Analyst supports.

*Why were reports exposed for programs that don’t use HackerOne Triage?*
HackerOne offers an optional service called [Human-Augmented Signal](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/human-augmented-signal.html) (HAS). HackerOne Security Analysts have access to a separate HAS Inbox on their account where reports can be inspected before they’re forwarded to the customer. A number of reports from this particular Inbox were accessed.

*Why did it take two hours to notice the report?*
HackerOne aims to reply within 24 hours to any submission, including over the weekend. For high and critical severity vulnerabilities, HackerOne tries to respond within a couple of hours. The report to HackerOne’s bug bounty program was submitted on Sunday morning at 05:00am PST (where the majority of HackerOne’s security team resides). For critical submissions, HackerOne’s security team automatically receives a notification on Slack. This works during business hours but is unreliable over the weekend. Security Analysts who work over the weekend noticed the report two hours after the submission, after which they immediately followed Incident Response procedures.

## Resolution and Recovery

The session cookie was revoked by HackerOne on November 24, 2019 at 15:11 UTC, two hours after it was shared, three minutes after the report was opened for triage. Revoking the session cookie rendered it useless to anyone using it. The subsequent investigation focused on affected customers, vulnerability data, intent, communication, and preventative measures, which concluded on November 26, 2019.

HackerOne audited existing comments to see if other session cookies were leaked in the past. This did not yield any results.

The severity of the report was determined to be high based on HackerOne’s environmental score for the selected asset and CVSS 3.0 base metrics (*CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H*). The minimum bounty award for a high severity vulnerability (based on CVSS) on hackerone.com is currently set to $7,500. A $7,500 reward for disclosing this to HackerOne would mean that HackerOne would award the same amount regardless of which user’s account was compromised. The team looked into the amount of sensitive information that could have been accessed by the account and took that under advisement when deciding on the bounty amount. This led to the decision to treat the submission as a critical vulnerability and award a $20,000 bounty.

## Vulnerability Impact on Data

Sensitive information of multiple objects was exposed. During the timeframe the hacker had access, three different features were used to access sensitive information. By default, all inboxes only download the minimal amount of data, such as title, state, severity, and assignee, so the user can view the user interface. Vulnerability information is only disclosed when the user selects a report from the user interface.

In an effort to simplify what data was accessed, HackerOne mapped the access of features to the information disclosed as follows:

 - If the hacker accessed their report via HAS Inbox, Triage Inbox, or Inbox features, the *report titles and limited metadata were viewable*
 - If the hacker used the Report View feature, the *report contents were viewable*

Below is an overview of the features and the data that was exposed in each of them. 

### Human-Augmented Signal (HAS) Inbox

This Inbox is used by a number of Security Analysts to block or forward submissions that are flagged by HackerOne’s backend of having a high-likelihood being noise. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report. |
| created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted.|
| title | The title of the report. |
| state | Indicates whether the report is open or closed.|
| substate | Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate). |
| assignee (group name, username) | The group’s name or user’s username who is currently assigned to the report. |
|reporter (username) | The reporter’s username.|
| program (handle, name) | The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to. |

### Triage Inbox

This is the Security Analyst’s main Inbox to interact with reports. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 100 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
|title| The title of the report.|
|substate|Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate).|

| program (handle, triage notes) | The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to.|

### Inbox

This is the main Inbox hackers and customers use to interact with reports they’ve submitted and received. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted depending on the view that was selected. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report.|
|created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted. |
| title | The title of the report.|
| state | Indicates whether the report is open or closed. |

### Report View

Reports are viewable in all of the inboxes in order to help customers, security analysts, and hackers communicate over a vulnerability. Only a single report can be viewed in the same window at any given time. When the hacker viewed the report, the following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| vulnerability_information|The initial description of the vulnerability provided by the reporter.|
|comments (text, internal and to the reporter)|The comments between the reporter and the security team as well as internal comments.|

|weakness|The category of vulnerability.|

**Data access was limited to the access the HackerOne Security Analyst had, which does not cover HackerOne’s entire customer base. If your data was accessed during this incident, you have received a separate notification from HackerOne.**

## Preventative Measures

As part of HackerOne Incident Response process, HackerOne is conducting an internal review and analysis of the incident. HackerOne is taking the following actions to address the underlying causes of issues and to help prevent future occurrence:

### Short-term (completed)

These are the short term actions identified. All items have already been addressed and deployed to hackerone.com.

#### Bind Sessions to IP Addresses
The session cookie is able to be reused on different devices. A short term mitigation of this vulnerability is to bind the user’s session to the IP address used at initial sign-in. If an attempt is made to utilize the session from a different IP address, the session is terminated.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 25, 2019.

#### Block Sessions from Restricted Countries
HackerOne restricts its employees from accessing resources from specific countries. To mitigate account takeovers, the user sessions are prevented from being used from specific restricted list of countries.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 26, 2019.

#### Page on Critical Reports
In order to further reduce the time to notify the security team, the team has decided to move from a Slack notification to paging the on-call security person when a critical report gets submitted to the bug bounty program.

This change was implemented on November 25, 2019.

#### Update Program Policy regarding Sensitive Information Access
HackerOne has updated their bug bounty program policy to include specific actions on when a hacker may have access to a HackerOne account, sensitive keys, or sensitive data.

This change was [implemented on November 26, 2019](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684).

### Mid-term (next three months)

#### Detect & Redact Sensitive Data in Comments
When a user is making a comment, detect possible sensitive information, such as session cookies and authentication tokens, and block submission of the comment until confirmation. Additionally, offer the user the ability to redact the sensitive from the comment automatically.

This change was implemented on December 2, 2019.

#### Add Additional Logging Context

While HackerOne was able to determine which reports were access based on the executed GraphQL queries, HackerOne is planning to improve their logging of information around data access. This will support Incident Response capabilities and allow the incident response to be performed faster.

#### Bind Sessions to Devices

A limitation of binding to IPs is that they change for legitimate reasons and will unauthenticate the user, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, IP addresses do not uniquely identify a user (such as with NAT), allowing malicious users to utilize the session, even if it is IP bound. To improve usability and security, HackerOne will investigate binding the session to a specific device that the user is using. Sessions bound to the device will only be usable on that device and using the session elsewhere will terminate the session.

#### Improve Education for Employees

In addition to HackerOne’s current employee education programs, HackerOne will expand the security training for those who handle vulnerability reports. The training will include additional details on how to share technical reproductions and specifically avoid sharing keys, tokens, and session information.

### Long-term (next twelve months)

#### Overhaul Security Analyst Permission Model
The HackerOne Security Analysts have access to HackerOne customers’ sensitive data in order to triage incoming vulnerability reports. HackerOne has identified that HackerOne can restrict security analyst access in programs, as well as overhaul the allocation of security analysts to a more restrictive list of programs to keep these users to the least privilege required. 

#### Improve Education for Hackers

As the community grows, HackerOne needs to ensure that HackerOne is reinforcing the best practices in bug bounty hunting. The HackerOne Community team will look to increase hacker education around delivering proof of critical severity vulnerabilities in case sensitive information has been accessed by the hacker.

If your data was accessed during this incident, you have received a separate notification from HackerOne.**\\\\n\\\\n## Preventative Measures\\\\n\\\\nAs part of HackerOne Incident Response process, HackerOne is conducting an internal review and analysis of the incident. HackerOne is taking the following actions to address the underlying causes of issues and to help prevent future occurrence:\\\\n\\\\n### Short-term (completed)\\\\n\\\\nThese are the short term actions identified. All items have already been addressed and deployed to hackerone.com.\\\\n\\\\n#### Bind Sessions to IP Addresses\\\\nThe session cookie is able to be reused on different devices. A short term mitigation of this vulnerability is to bind the user’s session to the IP address used at initial sign-in. If an attempt is made to utilize the session from a different IP address, the session is terminated.\\\\n\\\\nThis change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 25, 2019.\\\\n\\\\n#### Block Sessions from Restricted Countries\\\\nHackerOne restricts its employees from accessing resources from specific countries. To mitigate account takeovers, the user sessions are prevented from being used from specific restricted list of countries.\\\\n\\\\nThis change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 26, 2019.\\\\n\\\\n#### Page on Critical Reports\\\\nIn order to further reduce the time to notify the security team, the team has decided to move from a Slack notification to paging the on-call security person when a critical report gets submitted to the bug bounty program.\\\\n\\\\nThis change was implemented on November 25, 2019.\\\\n\\\\n#### Update Program Policy regarding Sensitive Information Access\\\\nHackerOne has updated their bug bounty program policy to include specific actions on when a hacker may have access to a HackerOne account, sensitive keys, or sensitive data.\\\\n\\\\nThis change was [implemented on November 26, 2019](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684).\\\\n\\\\n### Mid-term (next three months)\\\\n\\\\n#### Detect & Redact Sensitive Data in Comments\\\\nWhen a user is making a comment, detect possible sensitive information, such as session cookies and authentication tokens, and block submission of the comment until confirmation. Additionally, offer the user the ability to redact the sensitive from the comment automatically.\\\\n\\\\nThis change was implemented on December 2, 2019.\\\\n\\\\n#### Add Additional Logging Context\\\\n\\\\nWhile HackerOne was able to determine which reports were access based on the executed GraphQL queries, HackerOne is planning to improve their logging of information around data access. This will support Incident Response capabilities and allow the incident response to be performed faster.\\\\n\\\\n#### Bind Sessions to Devices\\\\n\\\\nA limitation of binding to IPs is that they change for legitimate reasons and will unauthenticate the user, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, IP addresses do not uniquely identify a user (such as with NAT), allowing malicious users to utilize the session, even if it is IP bound. To improve usability and security, HackerOne will investigate binding the session to a specific device that the user is using. Sessions bound to the device will only be usable on that device and using the session elsewhere will terminate the session.\\\\n\\\\n#### Improve Education for Employees\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to HackerOne’s current employee education programs, HackerOne will expand the security training for those who handle vulnerability reports. The training will include additional details on how to share technical reproductions and specifically avoid sharing keys, tokens, and session information.\\\\n\\\\n### Long-term (next twelve months)\\\\n\\\\n#### Overhaul Security Analyst Permission Model\\\\nThe HackerOne Security Analysts have access to HackerOne customers’ sensitive data in order to triage incoming vulnerability reports. HackerOne has identified that HackerOne can restrict security analyst access in programs, as well as overhaul the allocation of security analysts to a more restrictive list of programs to keep these users to the least privilege required. \\\\n\\\\n#### Improve Education for Hackers\\\\n\\\\nAs the community grows, HackerOne needs to ensure that HackerOne is reinforcing the best practices in bug bounty hunting. The HackerOne Community team will look to increase hacker education around delivering proof of critical severity vulnerabilities in case sensitive information has been accessed by the hacker.\\\\n\\"}],\\"attachments\\":[],\\"activities\\":[{\\"id\\":6390330,\\"type\\":\\"report_title_updated\\",\\"updated_at\\":1574809432146,\\"created_at\\":1574601086479,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"},\\"changes\\":{\\"title\\":{\\"old\\":\\"██████████\\",\\"new\\":\\"█████████\\"}}},{\\"id\\":6390338,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"████████\\\\n█████\\",\\"updated_at\\":1574804280674,\\"created_at\\":1574601226613,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390601,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"i found what is you can edit private program ( for test ) I have not changed anything and not used , all for the sake of hacking\\",\\"created_at\\":1574605835449,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390724,\\"type\\":\\"bug_needs_more_info\\",\\"message\\":\\"In what report was the token disclosed?\\\\n\\",\\"created_at\\":1574608122776,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"ktistai\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/322/520/01cd21dce301646646276fd9125cffd448fbffd6_original.png/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\",\\"platform_triager\\":true}},{\\"id\\":6390739,\\"type\\":\\"bug_new\\",\\"message\\":\\" █████ here, ██████████\\",\\"updated_at\\":1574809583131,\\"created_at\\":1574608353419,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390741,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"If you need Proof, I can write a message ███.\\",\\"updated_at\\":1574809610985,\\"created_at\\":1574608394215,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390742,\\"type\\":\\"bug_needs_more_info\\",\\"message\\":\\"Can you check if it's still working? \\",\\"created_at\\":1574608446181,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"ktistai\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/322/520/01cd21dce301646646276fd9125cffd448fbffd6_original.png/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\",\\"platform_triager\\":true}},{\\"id\\":6390744,\\"type\\":\\"bug_new\\",\\"message\\":\\"Fixed, not working\\",\\"created_at\\":1574608507686,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390753,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"██████\\",\\"updated_at\\":1574809552866,\\"created_at\\":1574608839111,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"haxta4ok00\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/175/8449afdd3403f4de00b34719ee09823bad1c0a06_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\"}},{\\"id\\":6390756,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"@haxta4ok00 \\\\n\\\\nI asked the appropriate people on how we deal with such reports and as soon as there will be more information, we will let you know. \\\\n\\\\nThanks, \\\\n@ktistai\\",\\"created_at\\":1574608899849,\\"actor\\":{\\"handle\\":\\"ktistai\\",\\"picture_url\\":\\"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/322/520/01cd21dce301646646276fd9125cffd448fbffd6_original.png/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5\\",\\"platform_triager\\":true}},{\\"id\\":6391025,\\"type\\":\\"comment\\",\\"message\\":\\"Hi @haxta4ok00 thanks for reporting this so quickly, we really appreciate it!

As part of that, we’re updating the severity according to the impact of the vulnerability. At this point, we have not made a decision on the bounty amount, and it may be different from what our bounty table indicates. See below for our reasoning behind the corrected severity, which with the environmental score of the affected asset, brings the CVSS to 8.3 (High).\\\\n\\\\n**Attack Vector: Network** - The vulnerability was exploitable from anywhere in case the attacker had a copy of an active session cookie.\\\\n\\\\n**Attack Complexity: High** - The semi-feasible attack scenario is for a HackerOne employee to share an active session cookie. Carrying this out is beyond an attacker’s control, which is why the Attack Complexity to High.\\\\n\\\\n**Privileges Required: None** - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.\\\\n\\\\n**User Interaction: Required** - The victim needs to share the session cookie, making User Interaction Required for the vulnerability to be exploited.\\\\n\\\\n**Scope: Changed** - Due to the nature of the data that could’ve been accessed, systems other than hackerone.com may be accessible. Scope includes any customer assets because of the vulnerability information that could have been accessed.\\\\n\\\\n**Confidentiality: High** - Vulnerability information could be accessed when the attacker has an active session cookie of the HackerOne employee. Any security vulnerability that affects vulnerability information automatically bumps Confidentiality to High.\\\\n\\\\n**Integrity: High** - The HackerOne employee had sufficient privileges to make updates to programs they were managing, causing Impact to being set to High.\\\\n\\\\n**Availability: High** - Due to the HackerOne employee’s permissions, they could suspend submissions for a number of HackerOne customers.

Much appreciated for the responses. Especially thank you for confirming your removal of all screenshots and other data you may have downloaded as part of your report submission.

We can confirm that ██████ uses 2FA via SAML. That is, the built-in HackerOne 2FA functionality is not used, as our identity provider handles 2FA itself. Authentication to the HackerOne Platform is federated from our identity provider to HackerOne via SAML.

We’re still actively working on this, primarily preparing communications to affected customers and a root cause analysis. As part of that, we’re updating the severity according to the impact of the vulnerability. At this point, we have not made a decision on the bounty amount, and it may be different from what our bounty table indicates. See below for our reasoning behind the corrected severity, which with the environmental score of the affected asset, brings the CVSS to 8.3 (High).

**Attack Vector: Network** - The vulnerability was exploitable from anywhere in case the attacker had a copy of an active session cookie.

**Attack Complexity: High** - The semi-feasible attack scenario is for a HackerOne employee to share an active session cookie. Carrying this out is beyond an attacker’s control, which is why the Attack Complexity to High.

**Privileges Required: None** - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction: Required** - The victim needs to share the session cookie, making User Interaction Required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Scope: Changed** - Due to the nature of the data that could’ve been accessed, systems other than hackerone.com may be accessible. Scope includes any customer assets because of the vulnerability information that could have been accessed.

**Confidentiality: High** - Vulnerability information could be accessed when the attacker has an active session cookie of the HackerOne employee. Any security vulnerability that affects vulnerability information automatically bumps Confidentiality to High.

**Integrity: High** - The HackerOne employee had sufficient privileges to make updates to programs they were managing, causing Impact to being set to High.

**Availability: High** - Due to the HackerOne employee’s permissions, they could suspend submissions for a number of HackerOne customers. Although this technically doesn’t affect the availability of the platform, the team ended up going with a High impact because submissions are a business critical process on the platform.",

* Three years ago I mentioned such an attack, but it was theoretical and I was not listened to( here #163381 I wrote \`in theory find this in the future\`). If this will help the I am systemic moderator on one of forums on security. And we protected ourselves from such attacks by binding the session to the IP address at the entrance. We also made basic authorization for access to private sections. Perhaps this will help you.

* I understand, that saw data which should not was see, but this was only hack interest in white purposes, I wanted to watch and show you to prejudice consequence of this can lead ( I've always been taught to write the full impact that can be) . It was a happy white hacking for me.

As for your first remark: yesterday we've released an update that limits HackerOne employees and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to the IP address that they've started the session with. This would've prevented the incident. We're postponing the rollout to all users due to people having legitimate use cases for using multiple IP addresses (e.g. ISPs with DHCP). We're also planning to roll out a number of smaller changes, such as warning the user when a comment seems to contain sensitive information and clarification in our policy about what to do when someone gains access to other people their account.

During our Incident Response process, we noticed that a few reports were accessed after you submitted the report to us. Although we understand why you did so, we’d like to stress that this behavior may disqualify you from a bounty in the future. In this particular case, we correlated the page views that were made after the submission with your comments providing more information to us to substantiate your claims. It also seemed that no information was withheld by you in this report.

To make it clear on how we believe these situations should be handled by hackers, [we’ve added a clarifying section to our policy](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684). We urge you to review this section, which will reduce the blast radius going forward. We’d like for you to continue to be a valuable member of the community and our top hacker, but for that, we require you to be mindful of the access that particular vulnerabilities give you. Being responsible and understanding the potential consequences of your actions is very important in this field. We hope you understand and will take this into consideration going forward.

We’re planning to publicly disclose this report on December 3, 2019 at 9:00am PST.

*Last updated: 2019-11-27*

## Issue Summary
On November 24, 2019 at 13:08 UTC, HackerOne was notified through the HackerOne Bug Bounty Program by a HackerOne community member (“hacker”) that they had accessed a HackerOne Security Analyst’s HackerOne account. A session cookie was disclosed due to a human error, which led to the hacker being able to access the account. The session cookie was revoked at 15:11 UTC, blocking all unauthorized access to the account.

The technical investigation finished at 21:27 UTC, concluding that there was no malicious intent and that all copies of potentially sensitive information were deleted.

## Timeline

| Date | Time (UTC)| Action |
|---|---|---|
| 2019-11-24 | 12:48 | HackerOne Security Analyst’s session cookie was posted on a HackerOne report. |
| 2019-11-24 | 13:08 | HackerOne received a report through its bug bounty program that the session cookie could be used to access sensitive information. |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:08 | A HackerOne Security Analyst began triaging the report.  |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:11 | The session cookie was revoked. |
| 2019-11-24 | 16:07 | HackerOne’s Incident Response team started an investigation. |
| 2019-11-24 | 21:27 | HackerOne concluded technical investigation. |
| 2019-11-25 | 08:49 | Impacted customers were alerted that their information was viewable to the hacker who submitted the vulnerability. |
| 2019-11-26 | 01:58 | A change was deployed restricting HackerOne employee and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to only be accessible from the originating IP address. This mitigates similar incidents in the future. |

## Root Cause
HackerOne triages incoming reports for HackerOne’s own bug bounty program. On November 24, 2019, a Security Analyst tried to reproduce a submission to HackerOne’s program, which failed. The Security Analyst replied to the hacker, accidentally including one of their own valid session cookies.

*Why was a cookie included?*
When a Security Analyst fails to reproduce a potentially valid security vulnerability, they go back and forth with the hacker to better understand the report. During this dialogue, Security Analysts may include steps they’ve taken in their response to the report, including HTTP requests that they made to reproduce. In this particular case, parts of a cURL command, copied from a browser console, were not removed before posting it to the report, disclosing the session cookie.

*Why was the hacker able to access the account?*
Session cookies are tied to a particular application, in this case hackerone.com. The application won’t block access when a session cookie gets reused in another location. This was a known risk. As many of HackerOne’s users work from mobile connections and through proxies, blocking access would degrade the user experience for those users. Due to the entropy of session cookies and in-depth defenses such as HackerOne’s strict [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy), HackerOne had not prioritized any additional defenses that limit a session cookie’s ability to be used in a separate browser.

*Why does a session cookie grant access to reports?*
HackerOne offers a number of additional tools on the platform for Security Analysts to work through security reports. In a normal situation, the Security Analysts go through multi-factor Single Sign-On (SSO) to obtain a valid session cookie for their work. Because a live session cookie was obtained, all platform features were available, which therefore granted access to a number of customers’ reports. This was limited to the customer programs that this particular Security Analyst supports.

*Why were reports exposed for programs that don’t use HackerOne Triage?*
HackerOne offers an optional service called [Human-Augmented Signal](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/human-augmented-signal.html) (HAS). HackerOne Security Analysts have access to a separate HAS Inbox on their account where reports can be inspected before they’re forwarded to the customer. A number of reports from this particular Inbox were accessed.

*Why did it take two hours to notice the report?*
HackerOne aims to reply within 24 hours to any submission, including over the weekend. For high and critical severity vulnerabilities, HackerOne tries to respond within a couple of hours. The report to HackerOne’s bug bounty program was submitted on Sunday morning at 05:00am PST (where the majority of HackerOne’s security team resides). For critical submissions, HackerOne’s security team automatically receives a notification on Slack. This works during business hours but is unreliable over the weekend. Security Analysts who work over the weekend noticed the report two hours after the submission, after which they immediately followed Incident Response procedures.

## Resolution and Recovery

The session cookie was revoked by HackerOne on November 24, 2019 at 15:11 UTC, two hours after it was shared, three minutes after the report was opened for triage. Revoking the session cookie rendered it useless to anyone using it. The subsequent investigation focused on affected customers, vulnerability data, intent, communication, and preventative measures, which concluded on November 26, 2019.

HackerOne audited existing comments to see if other session cookies were leaked in the past. This did not yield any results.

The severity of the report was determined to be high based on HackerOne’s environmental score for the selected asset and CVSS 3.0 base metrics (*CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H*). The minimum bounty award for a high severity vulnerability (based on CVSS) on hackerone.com is currently set to $7,500. A $7,500 reward for disclosing this to HackerOne would mean that HackerOne would award the same amount regardless of which user’s account was compromised. The team looked into the amount of sensitive information that could have been accessed by the account and took that under advisement when deciding on the bounty amount. This led to the decision to treat the submission as a critical vulnerability and award a $20,000 bounty.

## Vulnerability Impact on Data

Sensitive information of multiple objects was exposed. During the timeframe the hacker had access, three different features were used to access sensitive information. By default, all inboxes only download the minimal amount of data, such as title, state, severity, and assignee, so the user can view the user interface. Vulnerability information is only disclosed when the user selects a report from the user interface.

In an effort to simplify what data was accessed, HackerOne mapped the access of features to the information disclosed as follows:

 - If the hacker accessed their report via HAS Inbox, Triage Inbox, or Inbox features, the *report titles and limited metadata were viewable*
 - If the hacker used the Report View feature, the *report contents were viewable*

Below is an overview of the features and the data that was exposed in each of them. 

### Human-Augmented Signal (HAS) Inbox

This Inbox is used by a number of Security Analysts to block or forward submissions that are flagged by HackerOne’s backend of having a high-likelihood being noise. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report. |
| created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted.|
| title | The title of the report. |
| state | Indicates whether the report is open or closed.|
| substate | Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate). |
| assignee (group name, username) | The group’s name or user’s username who is currently assigned to the report. |
|reporter (username) | The reporter’s username.|
| program (handle, name) | The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to. |

### Triage Inbox

This is the Security Analyst’s main Inbox to interact with reports. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 100 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
|title| The title of the report.|
|substate|Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate).|
| assignee (group name, username) | The group’s name or user’s username who is currently assigned to the report.|
|triage blockers (reasons, blocked by) | An object that contains the reason why a report is currently blocked on something other than the Security Analysts. |
| program (handle, triage notes) | The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to.|

### Inbox

This is the main Inbox hackers and customers use to interact with reports they’ve submitted and received. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted depending on the view that was selected. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report.|
|created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted. |
| title | The title of the report.|
| state | Indicates whether the report is open or closed. |
|substate | Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate).|
|reference | Any issue tracker reference that was set on the report.|
|reference_url|The full URL to any issue tracker’s task when set.|
|severity_rating|Indicates the report’s severity (null, none, low, medium, high, critical).|
|assignee (group name, username)|The group’s name or user’s username who is currently assigned to the report.|
|reporter (username)|The reporter’s username.|
|program (handle, name)|The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to.|
|custom_field_attributes (name)|All custom field attributes that reports can be filtered on.|
|assets (identifier)|All asset identifiers that reports can be filtered on.|
|groups (name)|All team member groups associated with the program the report was submitted to.|
|members (name, username)|All team members associated with the program the report was submitted to.|

### Report View

Reports are viewable in all of the inboxes in order to help customers, security analysts, and hackers communicate over a vulnerability. Only a single report can be viewed in the same window at any given time. When the hacker viewed the report, the following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| vulnerability_information|The initial description of the vulnerability provided by the reporter.|
|comments (text, internal and to the reporter)|The comments between the reporter and the security team as well as internal comments.|
|latest_activity_at|ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report.|
|created_at|ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted.|
|title|The title of the report.|
|state|Indicates whether the report is open or closed.|
|substate|Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate).|
|reference|Any issue tracker reference that was set on the report.|

|groups (name)|All team member groups associated with the program the report was submitted to.|
|members (name, username)|All team members associated with the program the report was submitted to.|
|weakness|The category of vulnerability.|

**Data access was limited to the access the HackerOne Security Analyst had, which does not cover HackerOne’s entire customer base. If your data was accessed during this incident, you have received a separate notification from HackerOne.**

## Preventative Measures

As part of HackerOne Incident Response process, HackerOne is conducting an internal review and analysis of the incident. HackerOne is taking the following actions to address the underlying causes of issues and to help prevent future occurrence:

### Short-term (completed)

These are the short term actions identified. All items have already been addressed and deployed to hackerone.com.

#### Bind Sessions to IP Addresses
The session cookie is able to be reused on different devices. A short term mitigation of this vulnerability is to bind the user’s session to the IP address used at initial sign-in. If an attempt is made to utilize the session from a different IP address, the session is terminated.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 25, 2019.

#### Block Sessions from Restricted Countries
HackerOne restricts its employees from accessing resources from specific countries. To mitigate account takeovers, the user sessions are prevented from being used from specific restricted list of countries.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 26, 2019.

#### Page on Critical Reports
In order to further reduce the time to notify the security team, the team has decided to move from a Slack notification to paging the on-call security person when a critical report gets submitted to the bug bounty program.

This change was implemented on November 25, 2019.

#### Update Program Policy regarding Sensitive Information Access
HackerOne has updated their bug bounty program policy to include specific actions on when a hacker may have access to a HackerOne account, sensitive keys, or sensitive data.

This change was [implemented on November 26, 2019](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684).

### Mid-term (next three months)

#### Detect & Redact Sensitive Data in Comments
When a user is making a comment, detect possible sensitive information, such as session cookies and authentication tokens, and block submission of the comment until confirmation. Additionally, offer the user the ability to redact the sensitive from the comment automatically.

This change was implemented on December 2, 2019.

#### Add Additional Logging Context

While HackerOne was able to determine which reports were access based on the executed GraphQL queries, HackerOne is planning to improve their logging of information around data access. This will support Incident Response capabilities and allow the incident response to be performed faster.

#### Bind Sessions to Devices

A limitation of binding to IPs is that they change for legitimate reasons and will unauthenticate the user, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, IP addresses do not uniquely identify a user (such as with NAT), allowing malicious users to utilize the session, even if it is IP bound. To improve usability and security, HackerOne will investigate binding the session to a specific device that the user is using. Sessions bound to the device will only be usable on that device and using the session elsewhere will terminate the session.

#### Improve Education for Employees

In addition to HackerOne’s current employee education programs, HackerOne will expand the security training for those who handle vulnerability reports. The training will include additional details on how to share technical reproductions and specifically avoid sharing keys, tokens, and session information.

### Long-term (next twelve months)

#### Overhaul Security Analyst Permission Model
The HackerOne Security Analysts have access to HackerOne customers’ sensitive data in order to triage incoming vulnerability reports. HackerOne has identified that HackerOne can restrict security analyst access in programs, as well as overhaul the allocation of security analysts to a more restrictive list of programs to keep these users to the least privilege required. 

#### Improve Education for Hackers

As the community grows, HackerOne needs to ensure that HackerOne is reinforcing the best practices in bug bounty hunting. The HackerOne Community team will look to increase hacker education around delivering proof of critical severity vulnerabilities in case sensitive information has been accessed by the hacker.

We’re still actively working on this, primarily preparing communications to affected customers and a root cause analysis. As part of that, we’re updating the severity according to the impact of the vulnerability. At this point, we have not made a decision on the bounty amount, and it may be different from what our bounty table indicates. See below for our reasoning behind the corrected severity, which with the environmental score of the affected asset, brings the CVSS to 8.3 (High).

**Attack Vector: Network** - The vulnerability was exploitable from anywhere in case the attacker had a copy of an active session cookie.

**Attack Complexity: High** - The semi-feasible attack scenario is for a HackerOne employee to share an active session cookie. Carrying this out is beyond an attacker’s control, which is why the Attack Complexity to High.

**Privileges Required: None** - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction: Required** - The victim needs to share the session cookie, making User Interaction Required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Scope: Changed** - Due to the nature of the data that could’ve been accessed, systems other than hackerone.com may be accessible. Scope includes any customer assets because of the vulnerability information that could have been accessed.

**Confidentiality: High** - Vulnerability information could be accessed when the attacker has an active session cookie of the HackerOne employee. Any security vulnerability that affects vulnerability information automatically bumps Confidentiality to High.

**Integrity: High** - The HackerOne employee had sufficient privileges to make updates to programs they were managing, causing Impact to being set to High.

**Availability: High** - Due to the HackerOne employee’s permissions, they could suspend submissions for a number of HackerOne customers. Although this technically doesn’t affect the availability of the platform, the team ended up going with a High impact because submissions are a business critical process on the platform.",

* Three years ago I mentioned such an attack, but it was theoretical and I was not listened to( here #163381 I wrote \`in theory find this in the future\`). If this will help the I am systemic moderator on one of forums on security. And we protected ourselves from such attacks by binding the session to the IP address at the entrance. We also made basic authorization for access to private sections. Perhaps this will help you.

* I understand, that saw data which should not was see, but this was only hack interest in white purposes, I wanted to watch and show you to prejudice consequence of this can lead ( I've always been taught to write the full impact that can be) . It was a happy white hacking for me.

As for your first remark: yesterday we've released an update that limits HackerOne employees and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to the IP address that they've started the session with. This would've prevented the incident. We're postponing the rollout to all users due to people having legitimate use cases for using multiple IP addresses (e.g. ISPs with DHCP). We're also planning to roll out a number of smaller changes, such as warning the user when a comment seems to contain sensitive information and clarification in our policy about what to do when someone gains access to other people their account.

During our Incident Response process, we noticed that a few reports were accessed after you submitted the report to us. Although we understand why you did so, we’d like to stress that this behavior may disqualify you from a bounty in the future. In this particular case, we correlated the page views that were made after the submission with your comments providing more information to us to substantiate your claims. It also seemed that no information was withheld by you in this report.

To make it clear on how we believe these situations should be handled by hackers, [we’ve added a clarifying section to our policy](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684). We urge you to review this section, which will reduce the blast radius going forward. We’d like for you to continue to be a valuable member of the community and our top hacker, but for that, we require you to be mindful of the access that particular vulnerabilities give you. Being responsible and understanding the potential consequences of your actions is very important in this field. We hope you understand and will take this into consideration going forward.

*Last updated: 2019-11-27*

## Issue Summary
On November 24, 2019 at 13:08 UTC, HackerOne was notified through the HackerOne Bug Bounty Program by a HackerOne community member (“hacker”) that they had accessed a HackerOne Security Analyst’s HackerOne account. A session cookie was disclosed due to a human error, which led to the hacker being able to access the account. The session cookie was revoked at 15:11 UTC, blocking all unauthorized access to the account.

The technical investigation finished at 21:27 UTC, concluding that there was no malicious intent and that all copies of potentially sensitive information were deleted.

## Timeline

| Date | Time (UTC)| Action |
|---|---|---|
| 2019-11-24 | 12:48 | HackerOne Security Analyst’s session cookie was posted on a HackerOne report. |
| 2019-11-24 | 13:08 | HackerOne received a report through its bug bounty program that the session cookie could be used to access sensitive information. |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:08 | A HackerOne Security Analyst began triaging the report.  |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:11 | The session cookie was revoked. |
| 2019-11-24 | 16:07 | HackerOne’s Incident Response team started an investigation. |
| 2019-11-24 | 21:27 | HackerOne concluded technical investigation. |
| 2019-11-25 | 08:49 | Impacted customers were alerted that their information was viewable to the hacker who submitted the vulnerability. |
| 2019-11-26 | 01:58 | A change was deployed restricting HackerOne employee and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to only be accessible from the originating IP address. This mitigates similar incidents in the future. |

## Root Cause
HackerOne triages incoming reports for HackerOne’s own bug bounty program. On November 24, 2019, a Security Analyst tried to reproduce a submission to HackerOne’s program, which failed. The Security Analyst replied to the hacker, accidentally including one of their own valid session cookies.

*Why was a cookie included?*
When a Security Analyst fails to reproduce a potentially valid security vulnerability, they go back and forth with the hacker to better understand the report. During this dialogue, Security Analysts may include steps they’ve taken in their response to the report, including HTTP requests that they made to reproduce. In this particular case, parts of a cURL command, copied from a browser console, were not removed before posting it to the report, disclosing the session cookie.

*Why was the hacker able to access the account?*
Session cookies are tied to a particular application, in this case hackerone.com. The application won’t block access when a session cookie gets reused in another location. This was a known risk. As many of HackerOne’s users work from mobile connections and through proxies, blocking access would degrade the user experience for those users. Due to the entropy of session cookies and in-depth defenses such as HackerOne’s strict [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy), HackerOne had not prioritized any additional defenses that limit a session cookie’s ability to be used in a separate browser.

*Why does a session cookie grant access to reports?*
HackerOne offers a number of additional tools on the platform for Security Analysts to work through security reports. In a normal situation, the Security Analysts go through multi-factor Single Sign-On (SSO) to obtain a valid session cookie for their work. Because a live session cookie was obtained, all platform features were available, which therefore granted access to a number of customers’ reports. This was limited to the customer programs that this particular Security Analyst supports.

*Why were reports exposed for programs that don’t use HackerOne Triage?*
HackerOne offers an optional service called [Human-Augmented Signal](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/human-augmented-signal.html) (HAS). HackerOne Security Analysts have access to a separate HAS Inbox on their account where reports can be inspected before they’re forwarded to the customer. A number of reports from this particular Inbox were accessed.

*Why did it take two hours to notice the report?*
HackerOne aims to reply within 24 hours to any submission, including over the weekend. For high and critical severity vulnerabilities, HackerOne tries to respond within a couple of hours. The report to HackerOne’s bug bounty program was submitted on Sunday morning at 05:00am PST (where the majority of HackerOne’s security team resides). For critical submissions, HackerOne’s security team automatically receives a notification on Slack. This works during business hours but is unreliable over the weekend. Security Analysts who work over the weekend noticed the report two hours after the submission, after which they immediately followed Incident Response procedures.

## Resolution and Recovery

The session cookie was revoked by HackerOne on November 24, 2019 at 15:11 UTC, two hours after it was shared, three minutes after the report was opened for triage. Revoking the session cookie rendered it useless to anyone using it. The subsequent investigation focused on affected customers, vulnerability data, intent, communication, and preventative measures, which concluded on November 26, 2019.

HackerOne audited existing comments to see if other session cookies were leaked in the past. This did not yield any results.

The severity of the report was determined to be high based on HackerOne’s environmental score for the selected asset and CVSS 3.0 base metrics (*CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H*). The minimum bounty award for a high severity vulnerability (based on CVSS) on hackerone.com is currently set to $7,500. A $7,500 reward for disclosing this to HackerOne would mean that HackerOne would award the same amount regardless of which user’s account was compromised. The team looked into the amount of sensitive information that could have been accessed by the account and took that under advisement when deciding on the bounty amount. This led to the decision to treat the submission as a critical vulnerability and award a $20,000 bounty.

## Vulnerability Impact on Data

Sensitive information of multiple objects was exposed. During the timeframe the hacker had access, three different features were used to access sensitive information. By default, all inboxes only download the minimal amount of data, such as title, state, severity, and assignee, so the user can view the user interface. Vulnerability information is only disclosed when the user selects a report from the user interface.

In an effort to simplify what data was accessed, HackerOne mapped the access of features to the information disclosed as follows:

 - If the hacker accessed their report via HAS Inbox, Triage Inbox, or Inbox features, the *report titles and limited metadata were viewable*
 - If the hacker used the Report View feature, the *report contents were viewable*

Below is an overview of the features and the data that was exposed in each of them. 

### Human-Augmented Signal (HAS) Inbox

This Inbox is used by a number of Security Analysts to block or forward submissions that are flagged by HackerOne’s backend of having a high-likelihood being noise. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report. |
| created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted.|

**Data access was limited to the access the HackerOne Security Analyst had, which does not cover HackerOne’s entire customer base. If your data was accessed during this incident, you have received a separate notification from HackerOne.**

## Preventative Measures

As part of HackerOne Incident Response process, HackerOne is conducting an internal review and analysis of the incident. HackerOne is taking the following actions to address the underlying causes of issues and to help prevent future occurrence:

### Short-term (completed)

These are the short term actions identified. All items have already been addressed and deployed to hackerone.com.

#### Bind Sessions to IP Addresses
The session cookie is able to be reused on different devices. A short term mitigation of this vulnerability is to bind the user’s session to the IP address used at initial sign-in. If an attempt is made to utilize the session from a different IP address, the session is terminated.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 25, 2019.

#### Block Sessions from Restricted Countries
HackerOne restricts its employees from accessing resources from specific countries. To mitigate account takeovers, the user sessions are prevented from being used from specific restricted list of countries.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 26, 2019.

#### Page on Critical Reports
In order to further reduce the time to notify the security team, the team has decided to move from a Slack notification to paging the on-call security person when a critical report gets submitted to the bug bounty program.

This change was implemented on November 25, 2019.

#### Update Program Policy regarding Sensitive Information Access
HackerOne has updated their bug bounty program policy to include specific actions on when a hacker may have access to a HackerOne account, sensitive keys, or sensitive data.

This change was [implemented on November 26, 2019](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684).

### Mid-term (next three months)

#### Detect & Redact Sensitive Data in Comments
When a user is making a comment, detect possible sensitive information, such as session cookies and authentication tokens, and block submission of the comment until confirmation. Additionally, offer the user the ability to redact the sensitive from the comment automatically.

This change was implemented on December 2, 2019.

#### Add Additional Logging Context

While HackerOne was able to determine which reports were access based on the executed GraphQL queries, HackerOne is planning to improve their logging of information around data access. This will support Incident Response capabilities and allow the incident response to be performed faster.

#### Bind Sessions to Devices

A limitation of binding to IPs is that they change for legitimate reasons and will unauthenticate the user, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, IP addresses do not uniquely identify a user (such as with NAT), allowing malicious users to utilize the session, even if it is IP bound. To improve usability and security, HackerOne will investigate binding the session to a specific device that the user is using. Sessions bound to the device will only be usable on that device and using the session elsewhere will terminate the session.

#### Improve Education for Employees

In addition to HackerOne’s current employee education programs, HackerOne will expand the security training for those who handle vulnerability reports. The training will include additional details on how to share technical reproductions and specifically avoid sharing keys, tokens, and session information.

### Long-term (next twelve months)

#### Overhaul Security Analyst Permission Model
The HackerOne Security Analysts have access to HackerOne customers’ sensitive data in order to triage incoming vulnerability reports. HackerOne has identified that HackerOne can restrict security analyst access in programs, as well as overhaul the allocation of security analysts to a more restrictive list of programs to keep these users to the least privilege required. 

#### Improve Education for Hackers

As the community grows, HackerOne needs to ensure that HackerOne is reinforcing the best practices in bug bounty hunting. The HackerOne Community team will look to increase hacker education around delivering proof of critical severity vulnerabilities in case sensitive information has been accessed by the hacker.

Much appreciated for the responses. Especially thank you for confirming your removal of all screenshots and other data you may have downloaded as part of your report submission.

We can confirm that ██████ uses 2FA via SAML. That is, the built-in HackerOne 2FA functionality is not used, as our identity provider handles 2FA itself. Authentication to the HackerOne Platform is federated from our identity provider to HackerOne via SAML.

Again, thanks for reporting this to us. We'll be in touch soon on next steps.",

      "message": "Hi @haxta4ok00 - thanks again for bringing this to our attention. We’re still actively working on this, primarily preparing communications to affected customers and a root cause analysis. As part of that, we’re updating the severity according to the impact of the vulnerability. At this point, we have not made a decision on the bounty amount, and it may be different from what our bounty table indicates. See below for our reasoning behind the corrected severity, which with the environmental score of the affected asset, brings the CVSS to 8.3 (High).

**Attack Vector: Network** - The vulnerability was exploitable from anywhere in case the attacker had a copy of an active session cookie.

**Attack Complexity: High** - The semi-feasible attack scenario is for a HackerOne employee to share an active session cookie. Carrying this out is beyond an attacker’s control, which is why the Attack Complexity to High.

**Privileges Required: None** - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction: Required** - The victim needs to share the session cookie, making User Interaction Required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Scope: Changed** - Due to the nature of the data that could’ve been accessed, systems other than hackerone.com may be accessible. Scope includes any customer assets because of the vulnerability information that could have been accessed.

**Confidentiality: High** - Vulnerability information could be accessed when the attacker has an active session cookie of the HackerOne employee. Any security vulnerability that affects vulnerability information automatically bumps Confidentiality to High.

**Integrity: High** - The HackerOne employee had sufficient privileges to make updates to programs they were managing, causing Impact to being set to High.

**Availability: High** - Due to the HackerOne employee’s permissions, they could suspend submissions for a number of HackerOne customers. Although this technically doesn’t affect the availability of the platform, the team ended up going with a High impact because submissions are a business critical process on the platform.",

If this will help the I am systemic moderator on one of forums on security. And we protected ourselves from such attacks by binding the session to the IP address at the entrance. We also made basic authorization for access to private sections. Perhaps this will help you.

During our Incident Response process, we noticed that a few reports were accessed after you submitted the report to us. Although we understand why you did so, we’d like to stress that this behavior may disqualify you from a bounty in the future. In this particular case, we correlated the page views that were made after the submission with your comments providing more information to us to substantiate your claims. It also seemed that no information was withheld by you in this report.

To make it clear on how we believe these situations should be handled by hackers, [we’ve added a clarifying section to our policy](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684). We urge you to review this section, which will reduce the blast radius going forward. We’d like for you to continue to be a valuable member of the community and our top hacker, but for that, we require you to be mindful of the access that particular vulnerabilities give you. Being responsible and understanding the potential consequences of your actions is very important in this field. We hope you understand and will take this into consideration going forward.

*Last updated: 2019-11-27*

## Issue Summary
On November 24, 2019 at 13:08 UTC, HackerOne was notified through the HackerOne Bug Bounty Program by a HackerOne community member (“hacker”) that they had accessed a HackerOne Security Analyst’s HackerOne account. A session cookie was disclosed due to a human error, which led to the hacker being able to access the account. The session cookie was revoked at 15:11 UTC, blocking all unauthorized access to the account.

The technical investigation finished at 21:27 UTC, concluding that there was no malicious intent and that all copies of potentially sensitive information were deleted.

## Timeline

| Date | Time (UTC)| Action |
|---|---|---|
| 2019-11-24 | 12:48 | HackerOne Security Analyst’s session cookie was posted on a HackerOne report. |
| 2019-11-24 | 13:08 | HackerOne received a report through its bug bounty program that the session cookie could be used to access sensitive information. |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:08 | A HackerOne Security Analyst began triaging the report.  |
| 2019-11-24 | 15:11 | The session cookie was revoked. |
| 2019-11-24 | 16:07 | HackerOne’s Incident Response team started an investigation. |
| 2019-11-24 | 21:27 | HackerOne concluded technical investigation. |
| 2019-11-25 | 08:49 | Impacted customers were alerted that their information was viewable to the hacker who submitted the vulnerability. |
| 2019-11-26 | 01:58 | A change was deployed restricting HackerOne employee and HackerOne Security Analyst sessions to only be accessible from the originating IP address. This mitigates similar incidents in the future. |

## Root Cause
HackerOne triages incoming reports for HackerOne’s own bug bounty program. On November 24, 2019, a Security Analyst tried to reproduce a submission to HackerOne’s program, which failed. The Security Analyst replied to the hacker, accidentally including one of their own valid session cookies.

*Why was a cookie included?*
When a Security Analyst fails to reproduce a potentially valid security vulnerability, they go back and forth with the hacker to better understand the report. During this dialogue, Security Analysts may include steps they’ve taken in their response to the report, including HTTP requests that they made to reproduce. In this particular case, parts of a cURL command, copied from a browser console, were not removed before posting it to the report, disclosing the session cookie.

*Why was the hacker able to access the account?*
Session cookies are tied to a particular application, in this case hackerone.com. The application won’t block access when a session cookie gets reused in another location. This was a known risk. As many of HackerOne’s users work from mobile connections and through proxies, blocking access would degrade the user experience for those users. Due to the entropy of session cookies and in-depth defenses such as HackerOne’s strict [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy), HackerOne had not prioritized any additional defenses that limit a session cookie’s ability to be used in a separate browser.

*Why does a session cookie grant access to reports?*
HackerOne offers a number of additional tools on the platform for Security Analysts to work through security reports. In a normal situation, the Security Analysts go through multi-factor Single Sign-On (SSO) to obtain a valid session cookie for their work. Because a live session cookie was obtained, all platform features were available, which therefore granted access to a number of customers’ reports. This was limited to the customer programs that this particular Security Analyst supports.

*Why were reports exposed for programs that don’t use HackerOne Triage?*
HackerOne offers an optional service called [Human-Augmented Signal](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/human-augmented-signal.html) (HAS). HackerOne Security Analysts have access to a separate HAS Inbox on their account where reports can be inspected before they’re forwarded to the customer. A number of reports from this particular Inbox were accessed.

*Why did it take two hours to notice the report?*
HackerOne aims to reply within 24 hours to any submission, including over the weekend. For high and critical severity vulnerabilities, HackerOne tries to respond within a couple of hours. The report to HackerOne’s bug bounty program was submitted on Sunday morning at 05:00am PST (where the majority of HackerOne’s security team resides). For critical submissions, HackerOne’s security team automatically receives a notification on Slack. This works during business hours but is unreliable over the weekend. Security Analysts who work over the weekend noticed the report two hours after the submission, after which they immediately followed Incident Response procedures.

## Resolution and Recovery

The session cookie was revoked by HackerOne on November 24, 2019 at 15:11 UTC, two hours after it was shared, three minutes after the report was opened for triage. Revoking the session cookie rendered it useless to anyone using it. The subsequent investigation focused on affected customers, vulnerability data, intent, communication, and preventative measures, which concluded on November 26, 2019.

HackerOne audited existing comments to see if other session cookies were leaked in the past. This did not yield any results.

The severity of the report was determined to be high based on HackerOne’s environmental score for the selected asset and CVSS 3.0 base metrics (*CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H*). The minimum bounty award for a high severity vulnerability (based on CVSS) on hackerone.com is currently set to $7,500. A $7,500 reward for disclosing this to HackerOne would mean that HackerOne would award the same amount regardless of which user’s account was compromised. The team looked into the amount of sensitive information that could have been accessed by the account and took that under advisement when deciding on the bounty amount. This led to the decision to treat the submission as a critical vulnerability and award a $20,000 bounty.

## Vulnerability Impact on Data

Sensitive information of multiple objects was exposed. During the timeframe the hacker had access, three different features were used to access sensitive information. By default, all inboxes only download the minimal amount of data, such as title, state, severity, and assignee, so the user can view the user interface. Vulnerability information is only disclosed when the user selects a report from the user interface.

In an effort to simplify what data was accessed, HackerOne mapped the access of features to the information disclosed as follows:

 - If the hacker accessed their report via HAS Inbox, Triage Inbox, or Inbox features, the *report titles and limited metadata were viewable*
 - If the hacker used the Report View feature, the *report contents were viewable*

Below is an overview of the features and the data that was exposed in each of them. 

### Human-Augmented Signal (HAS) Inbox

This Inbox is used by a number of Security Analysts to block or forward submissions that are flagged by HackerOne’s backend of having a high-likelihood being noise. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report. |
| created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted.|
| title | The title of the report. |
| state | Indicates whether the report is open or closed.|
| substate | Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate). |
| assignee (group name, username) | The group’s name or user’s username who is currently assigned to the report. |
|reporter (username) | The reporter’s username.|
| program (handle, name) | The program’s handle and name the report was submitted to. |

### Triage Inbox

This is the Security Analyst’s main Inbox to interact with reports. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 100 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted by oldest report first. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
|title| The title of the report.|
|substate|Indicates the report’s state (new, triaged, needs-more-info, resolved, informative, spam, not-applicable, duplicate).|

### Inbox

This is the main Inbox hackers and customers use to interact with reports they’ve submitted and received. When the hacker accessed the page, the default view loaded up to 25 reports to show the user interface. Reports are sorted depending on the view that was selected. The following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| latest_activity_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the last activity (internal or external) was posted to the report.|
|created_at | ISO 8601 formatted date/time when the report was submitted. |

### Report View

Reports are viewable in all of the inboxes in order to help customers, security analysts, and hackers communicate over a vulnerability. Only a single report can be viewed in the same window at any given time. When the hacker viewed the report, the following information was loaded and displayed:

| Information | Note |
|---|---|
| vulnerability_information|The initial description of the vulnerability provided by the reporter.|
|comments (text, internal and to the reporter)|The comments between the reporter and the security team as well as internal comments.|

|weakness|The category of vulnerability.|

**Data access was limited to the access the HackerOne Security Analyst had, which does not cover HackerOne’s entire customer base. If your data was accessed during this incident, you have received a separate notification from HackerOne.**

## Preventative Measures

As part of HackerOne Incident Response process, HackerOne is conducting an internal review and analysis of the incident. HackerOne is taking the following actions to address the underlying causes of issues and to help prevent future occurrence:

### Short-term (completed)

These are the short term actions identified. All items have already been addressed and deployed to hackerone.com.

#### Bind Sessions to IP Addresses
The session cookie is able to be reused on different devices. A short term mitigation of this vulnerability is to bind the user’s session to the IP address used at initial sign-in. If an attempt is made to utilize the session from a different IP address, the session is terminated.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 25, 2019.

#### Block Sessions from Restricted Countries
HackerOne restricts its employees from accessing resources from specific countries. To mitigate account takeovers, the user sessions are prevented from being used from specific restricted list of countries.

This change was rolled out for HackerOne employees (including all HackerOne Security Analysts) on November 26, 2019.

#### Page on Critical Reports
In order to further reduce the time to notify the security team, the team has decided to move from a Slack notification to paging the on-call security person when a critical report gets submitted to the bug bounty program.

This change was implemented on November 25, 2019.

#### Update Program Policy regarding Sensitive Information Access
HackerOne has updated their bug bounty program policy to include specific actions on when a hacker may have access to a HackerOne account, sensitive keys, or sensitive data.

This change was [implemented on November 26, 2019](https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?change=3624684).

### Mid-term (next three months)

#### Detect & Redact Sensitive Data in Comments
When a user is making a comment, detect possible sensitive information, such as session cookies and authentication tokens, and block submission of the comment until confirmation. Additionally, offer the user the ability to redact the sensitive from the comment automatically.

This change was implemented on December 2, 2019.

#### Add Additional Logging Context

While HackerOne was able to determine which reports were access based on the executed GraphQL queries, HackerOne is planning to improve their logging of information around data access. This will support Incident Response capabilities and allow the incident response to be performed faster.

#### Bind Sessions to Devices

A limitation of binding to IPs is that they change for legitimate reasons and will unauthenticate the user, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, IP addresses do not uniquely identify a user (such as with NAT), allowing malicious users to utilize the session, even if it is IP bound. To improve usability and security, HackerOne will investigate binding the session to a specific device that the user is using. Sessions bound to the device will only be usable on that device and using the session elsewhere will terminate the session.

#### Improve Education for Employees

In addition to HackerOne’s current employee education programs, HackerOne will expand the security training for those who handle vulnerability reports. The training will include additional details on how to share technical reproductions and specifically avoid sharing keys, tokens, and session information.

### Long-term (next twelve months)

#### Overhaul Security Analyst Permission Model
The HackerOne Security Analysts have access to HackerOne customers’ sensitive data in order to triage incoming vulnerability reports. HackerOne has identified that HackerOne can restrict security analyst access in programs, as well as overhaul the allocation of security analysts to a more restrictive list of programs to keep these users to the least privilege required. 

#### Improve Education for Hackers

As the community grows, HackerOne needs to ensure that HackerOne is reinforcing the best practices in bug bounty hunting. The HackerOne Community team will look to increase hacker education around delivering proof of critical severity vulnerabilities in case sensitive information has been accessed by the hacker.

        "vulnerability_information": "During a trip to a conference, I discovered that the **Lyft **app allowed users to create expense reports by exporting business ride history as a PDF or CSV file. Being an active Lyft user, this was excellent news to me since it made my life easier by simplifying the tedious process of work travel expenses. But it also begged the question: “Can I hack this thing?” Turned out, the answer is **yes, thanks to my collaboration with Cody Brocious (@Daeken)**


# How Does It Work?

Once you complete a ride and rate or tip your driver, you are prompted with the following image that allows you to attach an expense code and note to it. Naturally, as I ended my ride at the airport, I placed an HTML tag for my expense info which allowed me access to an entirely new interface under the “Ride History” tab on the Lyft app. It showed me a section where it allowed me to select which rides I wanted to export into my expense repor.Once I selected my rides for my expenses, the Lyft application sent out an email where I received my expenses in two formats: CVS and PDF. And by opening the PDF I was able to confirm that the html tag (<h1>test) placed inside the “Expense Notes” was successfully rendered within the PDF:

{F847937}

This immediately caught my attention. I wanted to see if I would be able to exploit the PDF generator with SSRF being the possible outcome.


## Exploring SSRF

Once we confirmed that we could insert HTML into the PDF generator, the next step was to see if we could actually get the app to fetch external resources to gather information (such as user-agent), which would help us understand the application better. Keep in mind that this also required us to take a Lyft each time we wanted to try our payloads. We dedicated a few rides to getting the user agent by forcing the PDF generator to fetch a remote file from a web server controlled by us, using tags like \`<iframe>\` and \`<img>\`. But, unfortunately, we weren’t able to get any of that information at the time.

A few weeks later, HackerOne was hosting a Live Hacking Event in New York, which allowed us to take a ton of rides using the Lyft app and it was a great opportunity to revisit this bug. Our focus this time was to understand why some tags like <h1> or <u> were working in comparison to <img> or <iframe>. As mentioned earlier, the email also contains a CSV file exposing the exact string set as the expense code without rendering it. \\"Seeing this showed us our phone typo entering the payload, ‘left/right double quotation mark’ “ vs a regular quotation mark \\". Once we fixed this in our original payload, we took a ride, where we were able to get the PDF generator’s User-Agent, which shifted our focus from Lyft’s application to WeasyPrint instead.

# WeasyPrint

[WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) is a smart solution helping web developers create PDF documents. It turns simple HTML pages into gorgeous invoices, tickets, statistical reports… and it turns out it is also open sourced. Using WeasyPrint, you are able to create PDF files by feeding it an html template or URL. I have created a video on how to exploit WeasyPrint on YouTube, you should definitely check it out!

Here’s how WeasyPrint works, it takes an html template and creates a pdf from it. You can do this locally with the following command:

\`$> weasyprint input.html output.pdf\`

After installing an instance of it locally, we were able to understand how it all worked. This made our testing a lot easier since we no longer needed to take rides in order to test our payloads.

After a few attempts without reviewing the source, we had an initial understanding of how WeasyPrint worked: 

* It allows a small number of HTML tags 
* No Javascript or event handlers were allowed
* No iframe or similar tags were allowed either

After we reviewed a few files and discovered some interesting things in [html.py](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/b7a9fe7dcc9d0755a3324b74d0965e806bb87378/weasyprint/html.py), WeasyPrint had redefined a set of html tags including img, embed, object, and more. Based on our previous tests, we already knew that javascript was not an option in order to exploit this. At this point, our hopes were low and we started to think that the PDF generator was no longer exploitable until we discovered references to &lt;link> inside of several files including [pdf.py](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/b7a9fe7dcc9d0755a3324b74d0965e806bb87378/weasyprint/pdf.py). This allowed us to attach the content of any webpage or local file to our PDF by using “&lt;link rel=attachment href=\\"file:///root/secret.txt\\">”. 

Using zlib and python, we created a script that helped us unpack the content of local files from our pdf.


\`\`\`
import sys, zlib

def main(fn):
 data = open(fn, 'rb').read()
 i = 0
 first = True
 last = None
 while True:
 i = data.find(b'>>\\\\nstream\\\\n', i)
 if i == -1:
 break
 i += 10
 try:
 last = cdata = zlib.decompress(data[i:])
 if first:
 first = False
 else:
 pass#print cdata
 except:
 pass
 print(last.decode('utf-8'))

if __name__=='__main__':
 main(*sys.argv[1:])
\`\`\`

# One Last Ride

This gave us a working POC on our localhost, so we took one last ride using the Lyft app to test our payload and we were able to confirm the existence of this bug.

# Credits

A big thank you to the Lyft team, especially Vinay, for answering all of our questions and working closely with us to get this issue fixed. 

Thank you to Daeken for his brilliant ideas and being a great resource throughout this process.

And thank you to @d0nutptr for helping validate this vulnerability by taking a few rides for me while I was on an airplane.
